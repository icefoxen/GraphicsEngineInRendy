# Hello, Triangle

Okay, enough theoretical talk, let's get to code.

## Setup

First, naturally, we have to do some setup to create a window and handle an event loop.  We are using `winit`,
the de-facto standard for cross-platform windowing in Rust.  You can also use just about anything that will
give you a valid graphics context, including SDL, GLFW, or OS specific API calls.

`gfx-hal` provides

We will also use some helper crates to make life easier as we go: `log` and `env_logger` for logging.
