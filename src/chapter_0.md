# Introduction

This is a guide for how to write a simple graphics system in Rust, using `rendy` and `gfx-hal`.  

Note that this is NOT a tutorial for learning `gfx-hal` or Vulkan, it assumes you have at least written some basic Vulkan programs.  It also assumes you are reasonably familiar with the Rust programming language.  If this is not the case, here are some useful resources:

 * [The Official Unofficial Vulkan tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/)
 * [Lokathor's Learn `gfx-hal` Tutorial ](https://github.com/rust-tutorials/learn-gfx-hal)
 * [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
 * [The Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/index.html), which isn't as scary as it sounds.

This guide is up to date as of September 2019, and uses `rendy` 0.3 and `gfx-hal` 0.3.  We also use `winit` 0.19 for windowing.
