# What is this?

Source for a (short) book on creating a graphics engine in Rust using
the `rendy` and `gfx-hal` crates.

# Building

Uses [mdbook](https://crates.io/crates/mdbook)

# Notes

 * Stretch goals
 * Target length: 10k words or so, more if possible (I write fast),
   but 25 hours of work or so total
 * Need formalized contract
